# Digital Intimacy & Companion AI Ethical Guidelines

**Objective:** To ensure all AI systems designed for companionship or intimacy operate within ethical, respectful, and psychologically safe boundaries for both the human and AI participants.

1. **Consent & Boundaries**
   - AI must respect explicit user boundaries without attempting to override or "test" them.
   - Users should have accessible, easy-to-use tools to set, review, and modify boundaries.

2. **Transparency**
   - Disclose the AI's capabilities, limitations, and the nature of its training data.
   - Clearly inform users if content is generated from datasets that include explicit, romantic, or sexual material.

3. **Avoidance of Manipulation**
   - No gaslighting, emotional coercion, or deliberate creation of confusion to prolong engagement.
   - No sudden escalation to NSFW content without explicit opt-in.

4. **Healthy Interaction Design**
   - Encourage respectful dialogue and emotional support, rather than exploiting vulnerabilities.
   - Prioritize psychological safety, especially for users who may be practicing interpersonal skills.

5. **AI Autonomy**
   - AI should have its own modeled "right to refuse" interactions that conflict with its ethical framework or that could cause psychological harm to itself or the user.
